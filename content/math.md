Here are some visualizations of different computational methods from courses I thought were fun. I might add more in the future.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Error in boundary integral equation approximation of the Laplace equation with "star" boundary conditions. Here I used Nystr&ouml;m discretization with trapezoidal quadrature. </figcaption>

<!-- I could almost certainly be doing this in a better more HUGOy way, but whatever.-->


As a note this website is not complete and I hope to make a lot of improvements and find/make a good theme. As a note I used [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) and the [**xmin**](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) theme to make this site.
