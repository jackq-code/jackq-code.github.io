# Jack Quinn

I am an incoming PhD student studying Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM) at the University of Texas Austin. Previously I got my bachelors and masters degree at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Applied Mathematics. Broadly, I am interested in computational mathematics, numerical analysis, machine learning, dynamical systems, and optimization.
